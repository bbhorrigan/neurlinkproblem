Neuralink Electrode Data Compression Experiments
This repository contains various experiments to explore different data compression techniques suitable for compressing electrode data generated by the Neuralink N1 implant. The primary goal is to achieve more than 200x compression in real-time (< 1ms) while maintaining low power consumption (< 10mW).

Compression Techniques Explored
1. Run-Length Encoding (RLE)
RLE is a simple lossless compression method where consecutive repeated values (runs) are stored as a single value and a count. This technique is effective for data with lots of consecutive repeated values.

Example:
Original data: AAAAABBBCCDAA
Compressed data: 5A3B2C1D2A
